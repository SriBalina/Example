# Aapta (Heart rate Monitoring using IoT Sensors)

## How to run it on your system
To run Aapta on your system, you need to:
1. Clone this repository
2. Create an account, to save your data.
3. Connect your sensors to mobile using bluetooth.


## Inspiration
The inspiration behind Aapta is to provide an accessible and efficient way to monitor heart rate. By using IoT sensors and modern technology, we aim to make heart rate monitoring easier and more convenient for people.

## What it does
Aapta allows you to monitor your heart rate in real-time using IoT sensors and an Android Studio app. The sensors collect heart rate data and transfer it to the app via an Arduino board and Bluetooth. The app then displays the data in an easy-to-read format, so you can track your heart rate over time.

## How we built it
We built Aapta using Google Firebase and an Arduino board to connect the IoT sensors and transfer the data. We then used Android Studio to develop the app that displays the heart rate data.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges we faced was ensuring that the Bluetooth connection between the IoT sensors, Arduino board, and Android Studio app was stable and reliable. However, by using Google Firebase, we were able to overcome this challenge and create a seamless and efficient solution for heart rate monitoring.
